<p><strong>Privacy Policy and Use of Personal Information Used in Collections</strong></p>

<p>Personal information may be required to use certain features of the Citizen Historian Center website, such as editing, transcribing, and tagging documents prepared by another volunteer, using a feedback form, or participating in blog discussions.</p>

<p>We always inform you what information is required, and only use that information for its stated purpose. If you provide the information requested, then you consent to our using the information for the stated purpose. If you do not provide the information then some website features may be unavailable.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we work with third party applications that are not exclusively operated or controlled by the Library of Congress, to provide a better web presentation or user experience, such as for fulfilling online orders, emailing updates or collecting voluntarily-provided feedback.</p>

<p>These third-party sites and applications will either follow our privacy policy, or prominently display their own. The Library does not have access to any information collected by thirdâ€“party cookies or similar technologies on its sites. Other than these exceptions, and for authorized government law enforcement activities, we do not provide personal information to outside organizations without first obtaining your consent.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected for Measurement and Customization (Cookies)</strong></p>
<p>To help provide website visitors with the best experience possible, we use commercial software to report and analyze aggregated web metrics data. The data is generally retained indefinitely to help improve website performance.</p>
<p>Our sites use three types of tools:&nbsp;<a class="primary-text" href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/#session">session cookies</a>,&nbsp;<a class="primary-text" href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/#persistent">persistent cookies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="primary-text" href="https://www.loc.gov/legal/#other">other customization tools</a>. &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are small files that websites transfer to visitors&rsquo; computers to allow the site to remember specific information. If you do not want cookies transferred to your computer, you may&nbsp;<a class="primary-text" href="https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions">opt out</a>&nbsp;by changing your browser options.

If you do not provide the information then some website features may be unavailable.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we work with third party applications that are not exclusively operated or controlled by the Library of Congress, to provide a better web presentation or user experience, such as for fulfilling online orders, emailing updates or collecting voluntarily-provided feedback. These third-party sites and applications will either follow our privacy policy, or prominently display their own.

<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Part of our mission is reaching out to children in creative and educationally beneficial ways while still protecting their privacy. Our websites offering educational content to children under the age of 13 have links to their own privacy policies that comply with the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
<p>Some websites may include games or activities that require personally identifiable information. We do not use the information for any purpose other than the game or activity, and delete the information as soon as practical.</p>
<p>If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has made a request for information (such as through the&nbsp;<em>Ask a Librarian</em>service), we will respond to the request and then delete any identifying information. Similarly, if we learn that a child under 13 has posted personally identifiable information on any of our websites, we will delete the information.</p>
<p>We will disclose information about a child under the age of 13 if it is necessary to protect the child, the website itself, or to respond to a law enforcement inquiry.</p>
<p>We take children&rsquo;s privacy seriously, and encourage parents to contact us with any questions or concerns via the form at&nbsp;<a class="primary-text" href="http://www.loc.gov/contact/web-site-comments">www.loc.gov/contact/web-site-comments</a>. Similarly, parents who would like to notify us of personally identifiable information collected from a child under the age of 13 that should be deleted should contact us at the above address.</p>
<p><strong>About Our Web Surveys</strong></p>
<p>We use various types of online forms, including third-party forms and surveys, to collect opinions and feedback. Submitting information is voluntary.</p>
<p>We appreciate all comments and feedback from our visitors.</p>
